# Hyprland Dots V1
> [!NOTE]  
> I'm a newbie and since the start of this project I jumped from Mint to Arch, figured out how to use git, and wrote some simple bash scripts, so dont judge my config quality too harshly lol. I plan to write my own theming tool as my first real programming project so look out for that! Any suggestions, comments, or criticism would be hugely appreciated!
