# Hyprland Dots V1
Im tired of not being able to use whatever colors I want for all my programs! Down with having tons of diffrent config files to edit! My dots use bash scripts for easy switching of colors and layouts separately
> [!NOTE]  
> This has been my very first time both using arch, git, and scripting.(I'm very proud of myself for learning nomatter how hard its been lol) My scripts are very very very messy! However I found a cool tool called [flavours](https://github.com/misterio77/flavours) and will be replacing my color scripts with that
> 
> I plan on replacing almost every componate with eww or ags in V2!

## Easy layout and colors -land
> [!NOTE]  
> Now using [flavours](https://github.com/misterio77/flavours)!
> 
I tried to make it as simple as possible to define `layouts` and `colors`. Swapping color scemes or layout is as easy as running the `swapper.sh` script

## Todo
- [X] replace color change script with [flavours](https://github.com/misterio77/flavours)
- [ ] rework layout script

#### V2
- [ ] give the repo a cool name
- [ ] ! replace everything with eww or ags
- [ ] make fire/waterfox theme + startpage
- [ ] remake Sharp-GTK theme to use base16

#### V3
- [ ] simple GUI for changing colors/layout script
- [ ] cleanup scripts
- [ ] install script
