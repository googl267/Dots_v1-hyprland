# Awesome Softwear (a comprehensive list of everything so you don't look at a screenshot and go "whats that program?")
(really just here so I can remember what I use)

#### Kitty 
- terminal emulator
- cause cats r cute :3... but really because it displays images and easy to configure. I tried Wezterm but it's broken on Hyprland

#### Macchina
- fetch
- I love this fetch program so much I put it in my zshrc file. Super easy to make themes and configure

#### Zsh, Starship, Neovim, Joshuto
- productivity in the terminal
- Zsh: before I knew what a shell was, I found random internet tutorials to make your terminal look cool. Now I just like Zsh
- Starship: amazingly simple to configure and works everywhere
- Neovim: terminal file editor/IDE. I like learning how things work so I configured it from scratch and just kinda stuck with it. Still a noob at the keybinds tho
- Joshuto: ranger-like file manager written in rust. I just like the defaults and intergration with kitty for image previews

#### Floorp/Librewolf
- browsers
- floorp is packed full of features while librewolf hardens firefox out of the box. Floorp is best for my desktop while I run librewolf on my laptop

#### SDDM, Tofi, Waybar, SwayNC, Swayidle + Swaylock-effects, Swaybg
- Everything your GUI needs tbh
- SDDM: a nice greeter with some nice themes
- Tofi: tiny and fast application launcher
- Waybar: it's a crowd favorite bar and has really nice documentation. hyprland-cava-git version works out of the box
- SwayNC: supports almost every notification type and has a nice little panel I use for quick settings
- Swayidle + Swaylock: these two go together to handle screen timeout and locking. I like the screenshot blur Swaylock-effects has
- Swaybg: it just works(tm) for setting backgrounds

#### Qimgv, MPV, Cue, Foliate, Thunar
- GUI's for common desktop things like photos, videos, music, text/pdf, files, task viewer
- Qimgv: a tiny and quick image viewer/editor that I find to be the best balance between minimalist and useable
- MPV: the best video player in existance when you tweak it
- Cue: cute lil music player. I like its defaults
- Foliate: I use this as a PDF viewer since it themes itself to my GTK theme
- Thunar: a nice lil file manager for when I want to dragand drop

#### Bottom
- system process info
- I just like the way it looks and functions :3

#### Blender, Krita, Godot, OBS, Inkscape
- My every system apps: insanly powerful applications that all together take up less then a GB!
- Blender: it does everything.. some things really well and others not so much
- Krita: insanly powerful drawing platform with animation support, can also do image manipulation to an extent
- Godot: a game engine thats been making a lot of progress while being very lightweight
- OBS: screen recording/streaming
- Inkscape: very powerful vector art tool

#### Steam, Lutris, Itch.io, Prism Launcher
- If I'm going to be doing any kind of gaming these are my goto's

#### Dorion
- Disocrd in rust and runs on wayland, with plugin and theme support. Be aware the AUR package was really bad so if you are going to use this compile from source



### Notes
- GNU-IMP(GIMP) isn't on the list since Imgqv/Krita/Blender covers the majority of usecases
