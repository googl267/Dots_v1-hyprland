#Programs and their configs explained :3
(really just here so I can remember what I use)

#### Cue
- cute lil music player. I like its defaults

#### MPV
- the best video player in existance when you tweak it

#### Joshuto
- ranger file manager written in rust. I just like the defaults and intergration with kitty for image previews

#### Thunar
- a nice lil file manager for when I want to dragand drop

#### Bottom
- system process info. I like the way it looks

#### Swaybg
- it just works(tm) for setting backgrounds after I had problems with swww and hyprpaper

#### Macchina
- I love this fetch program so much I put it in my zshrc file. Super easy to make themes

#### Neovim
- terminal file editor/IDE. I like learning how things work so I configured it from scratch and just kinda stuck with it. Still a noob at the keybinds tho

#### Swayidle and Swaylock-effects
- these two go together to handle screen timeout and locking. I like the screenshot blur Swaylock-effects has

#### Waybar-hyprland-cava-git
- it's a crowd favorite bar and has really nice documentation. hyprland-cava-git version works out of the box

#### Tofi
- tiny and fast application launcher

#### SwayNC
- supports almost every notification type and has a nice little panel I use for quick settings

#### Qimgv
- a tiny and quick image viewer that I find to be the best balance between minimalist and useable

#### Zsh and Starship
- before I knew what a shell was random internet tutorials told me to download zsh. I never uninstalled it and I like it over bash
- starship is amazingly simple to configure and works everywhere

#### Floorp and Librewolf
- floorp is packed full of features while librewolf hardens firefox out of the box. Floorp is best for my desktop while I run librewolf on my laptop

#### Sddm
- a nice greeter with some nice themes

#### Kitty
- kitty cause cats r cute :3... but really because it displays images nativly
